## Prompts

This application was built using the following prompts to generate the content structure and code:

### Content Model Prompt

> "You are a skilled app developer with a strong background in creating innovative solutions for small businesses and enterprises. I want you to design an application named "Lynklathe Solutions" that facilitates connections between large companies like Ashok Leyland and TVS and small MSME lathe workers. The app should allow companies to post job proposals and drawings, enabling lathe workers to quote their amounts for the jobs. If a company's accepted quote matches their requirements, the chosen worker should receive a notification to proceed. Additionally, the worker's profile must include a quotation block, job tracking dialog, and live delivery tracking for both the company and the worker. The main screen of the app should feature a scrolling feed of news and job postings from both companies and workers. 
>
> Here's an example of an app interface I envision: The main screen displays a dynamic feed with job postings, while each worker's profile showcases their skills, past work, and current proposals. 
>
> I want you to also ensure the app is user-friendly and visually appealing, with intuitive navigation and responsiveness across devices. The output must be in a comprehensive design document format that outlines the app's features, user interface elements, and user experience flows. 
>
> I want you to also know that this app aims to enhance collaboration in the manufacturing sector, providing a seamless platform for job proposals and worker engagement.and with all indian languages as app languages"
